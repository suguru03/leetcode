## 0106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal

https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-inorder-and-postorder-traversal

Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given

inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]

Return the following binary tree:

    3

/ \
 9 20
/ \
 15 7
