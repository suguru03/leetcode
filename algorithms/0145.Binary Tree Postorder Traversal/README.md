## 0145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal

https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal

Given the root of abinary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1]

Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []

Example 3:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

Constraints:

    The number of the nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
