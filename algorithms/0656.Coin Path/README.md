## 656. Coin Path

https://leetcode.com/contest/leetcode-weekly-contest-44/problems/coin-path/

Given an array A (index starts at 1) consisting of N integers: A1, A2, ..., AN and an integer B. The integer B denotes that from any place (suppose the index is i) in the array A, you can jump to any one of the place in the array A indexed i+1, i+2, …, i+B if this place can be jumped to. Also, if you step on the index i, you have to pay Ai coins. If Ai is -1, it means you can’t jump to the place indexed i in the array.

Now, you start from the place indexed 1 in the array A, and your aim is to reach the place indexed N using the minimum coins. You need to return the path of indexes (starting from 1 to N) in the array you should take to get to the place indexed N using minimum coins.

If there are multiple paths with the same cost, return the lexicographically smallest such path.

If it's not possible to reach the place indexed N then you need to return an empty array.

Example 1:

```
Input: [1,2,4,-1,2], 2
Output: [1,3,5]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [1,2,4,-1,2], 1
Output: []
```

Note:
Path Pa1, Pa2, ..., Pan is lexicographically smaller than Pb1, Pb2, ..., Pbm, if and only if at the first i where Pai and Pbi differ, Pai < Pbi; when no such i exists, then n < m.
A1 >= 0. A2, ..., AN (if exist) will in the range of [-1, 100].
Length of A is in the range of [1, 1000].
B is in the range of [1, 100].
