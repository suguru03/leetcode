## 1044. Longest Duplicate Substring

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-duplicate-substring

Given a string S, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of S that occur 2 or more times.  (The occurrences may overlap.)

Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length.  (If S does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is "".)

Example 1:

Input: "banana"
Output: "ana"

Example 2:

Input: "abcd"
Output: ""

Note:

    2 <= S.length <= 10^5
    S consists of lowercase English letters.
