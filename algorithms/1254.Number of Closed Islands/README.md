## 1254. Number of Closed Islands

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-closed-islands

Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water).  An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.

Return the number of closed islands.

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Islands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water (group of 1s).

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
  [1,0,1,0,1,0,1],
  [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: 2

Constraints:

    1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100
    0 <= grid[i][j] <=1
